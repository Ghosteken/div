I'll help you implement this verification flow with occupation-based information filtering. First, let's create a new verification form component and modify the verification endpoint to handle this additional information.


Now let's update the server to handle the new verification flow with occupation-based information filtering.


I've implemented a complete verification flow with occupation-based information filtering. Here's what I've added:

1. Frontend Changes (HomePage.jsx):
   - Added a new verification form that appears after entering a valid code
   - Added occupation selection with predefined types
   - Added fields for viewer's name and purpose
   - Implemented form submission with priority-based verification

2. Backend Changes (server.js):
   - Added new `/api/verify/validate` endpoint for handling verification form data
   - Added new `/api/verify/ai-analysis` endpoint with occupation context
   - Implemented priority-based data filtering
   - Added verification logging
   - Created occupation-specific AI insights

3. Occupation Types and Priorities:
   - Employer (Priority 1): Full access to certificate details
   - Government Official (Priority 1): Full access to certificate details
   - Recruiter (Priority 1): Full access to certificate details
   - Academic Institution (Priority 2): Standard access with some restrictions
   - Other (Priority 3): Basic access to essential information only

4. AI Insights Based on Occupation:
   - Employer: Employment relevance and performance metrics
   - Academic: Academic standing and program alignment
   - Government: Regulatory compliance and legal status
   - Recruiter: Recruitment relevance and industry alignment
   - Other: Basic verification information

5. Data Storage:
   - Added verification logs to track who viewed certificates
   - Stores viewer information and purpose
   - Maintains verification history

The flow now works as follows:
1. User enters verification code
2. If valid, shows form requesting:
   - Full name
   - Occupation (from predefined list)
   - Purpose of verification
3. On form submission:
   - Validates information
   - Filters certificate data based on occupation priority
   - Generates occupation-specific AI insights
   - Shows filtered certificate with relevant insights

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation or add any additional features?
